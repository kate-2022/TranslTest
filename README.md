# TranslTest
This is the test version of my translation project.
In the original i´m doing the translation of any RNA sequence of interest into the corresponding peptide/protein sequence.
As there´s 20 essentiell amino acids to be compared to the corresponding RNA codons, i´m doing a test version with just the first two and the last one ( 3 in total) to avoid to change 20 classes in a row when there are changes necessary.. :D
